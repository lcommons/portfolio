Bag of Words | A schem for converting a text into a numerical representation of its words. Produces a sparse array where every element of the array represents a single word or n-gram in the corpus. For each word in a given text increment the corresponding element of the vector.  
n-gram | a token or set of tokens (e.g. token-pair, triplet, etc.)
TF-IDF |
TF | Token Frequency
IDF | Inverse Document Frequency
Token | a token is a word (NLP)
